So far, I've been unable to find an authoritative listing of incorporated US writers organizations. As a writer, knowing which organizations to join can be challenging. For instance, some of these organizations have missions focused on helping writers build careers, other have missions focused on promoting a genre. Either one could be beneficial to a writer.

I believe every writer should have a set of facts about an organization to help them decide which to join. This site's goal is to become a central reference for critical facts about the listed organizations.
