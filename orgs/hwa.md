## Mission

HWA is a charity that promotes the consumption (reading) and appreciation (study)
of horror, defines what passes for good horror through publications and awards,
encourages literacy using horror, and organizes educational and networking
opportunities for members.

From the [Horror Writers Association Bylaws, Article III]({{ org.bylaws_url }}):

> To encourage public interest in Horror and Dark Fantasy literature, and to encourage
> the reading of such literature through a wide use of school and public library facilities;
> to foster an appreciation of good Horror and Dark literature, both for pleasure and
> information, thus broadening the intellectual and cultural horizons of the general
> public and the members of the Corporation; to sponsor, edit, and disseminate writings,
> papers, books, pamphlets, and other publications which exemplify Horror and Dark
> Fantasy literature of high quality; to encourage literacy through the use of horror and
> dark fantasy literature; to conduct conferences, public discussion groups, forums,
> lectures, and seminar programs for the benefit of members and others, all for no
> pecuniary gain; and to use other lawful, appropriate, and genuine means for the
> attainment of these purposes.
